# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Visualization (https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-01-25-kl.-14.17.02.png)
      This is a stacked area chart of the growth of support for Affordable Care Act (ACA) by Voters over the years with 2015 having the highest.
        Aesthetic: The plot is pleasing to look at.
        Susbtantive: The data is easy to read off the plot.
        Perceptual: It is clear that the audience will notice the comparison between supporters and opposers over time with respect to the ACA.
        Others: I think the colors used are clear and easy to differentiate especially for accessibility reasons. The fonts are big enough to see the labels and annotations. The size of the image is also good.
        

      Bad Visualization (https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-01-29-kl.-14.30.37.png)
        I could not come up with a title for this plot and none was provided to guide the reader.
        maybe district comparison over time?

        Aesthetic: At first sight, the plot is pleasing to look at but the aesthetic seem to be unnecessary since it does not help with understanding the plot. Probably makes it more confusing.
        Susbtantive: It is not easy to read off the data from the plot. Even though there is a legend, it is still difficult to guide the eye
        Perceptual: I do notice that the plot is trying to compare countries and districts, but its still not clear to me.
        Others: I think the colors used will be difficult to differentiate especially for accessibility reasons.The legends did not help with understanding the plot either, quite difficult to follow. The fonts are small and therefore makes it harder to see the labels and annotations. The size of the image is good but the district buildings are unnecessary.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
        The bad visualization can be improved by keeping things simple since it helps convey the message better. Here are some suggestions;
        1. Simplify the legend with respect to the plotted data
        2. Add title to the plot to help the reader understand what it going on and being plotted
        3. Add labels and units to the x and y axis to help the reader to understand
        4. Avoid unnecessary figures that does not help to improve the understanding the plot, e.g. the district buildings
        5. Use better scales, ticks and annotations to facilitate reading off data from the plot
        6. Use colors with high contrast for easy identification and diferentiation
        7. Use larger fonts for texts, labels and ticks

      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
